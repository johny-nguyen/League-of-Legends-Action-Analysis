## Introduction
League of Legends is a multiplayer online battle arena developed by Riot Games in 2009. Over the years, the game has garnered worldwide attention, with tens of millions of active players on the game daily. In addition, the game's professional esports league have broke records with peaking viewership over the past couple of international tournaments. The dataset that I'll be using for this analysis will be esports data from 2025 which is taken from the Oracle's Elixir website.

With the introduction of Fearless draft, team compositions and strategies have taken the game to new heights. This dataset reveals several different statistics from all of the professional games that were played in 2025, such as winning teams, teamkills, and more. One metric I'm looking to expand upon is action.

In each match that is played, depending on the team composition, the audience may sit through two kinds of a games, a slow-paced game or a fast-paced one. With a slow-paced game, the primary focus for a team is to farm and scale and ultimately win through make strategic plays. However, a fast-paced game, the focus is on pure aggression and skirmishes especially early on to end the game as quickly as possible. When it comes to these two types of games, they both revolve around **action**.

The question I want to try and look at is **Looking at tier-one professional leagues, which league has the most "action-packed" games? Is the amount of "action" in this league significantly different than in other leagues?** To try and answer this question, I will be taking several ingame metrics to compute how "action-packed" matches are and compare them among different tier-one professional leagues. As for my predictive model, I will be looking to predict if a team won the game based on these action related metrics.

### Rows and Columns
In this dataset, there are over 100000 rows and 164 columns. For this specific question, we will only need a fraction of those columns to answer out question. Some of these key columns are:

## Assessment of Missingness


## Hypothesis Testing
